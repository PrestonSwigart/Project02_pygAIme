This project uses reinforcement learning to attempt to play "The Dinosaur Game".

Required Dependencies are as follows: numpy	2.0.2, pillow 10.4.0, pip 23.2.1, pygame 2.6.1, setuptools 68.2.0, and wheel 0.41.2.

game.py is my main method, where my game runs and implements the ai. ai.py is the file where the AI-Specific methods are stored.
So far, the longest my AI has lived was 23.1 seconds after hundreds of iterations.
My resources used were the repo I forked (https://github.com/ahmed4end/T-Rex-Runner-Python) which I modified to make work better.
I also used https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/q-learning-algorithm-with-step-by-step-implementation-using-python/ for assistance in the creation of my first AI. 
My second AI (AI2) used ChatGPT to assist in its creation.
